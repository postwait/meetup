# Monitoring Design Principles

##### Speaker: Theo Schlossnagle

## Abstract

Most engineering groups (and operations groups) find themselves int he weeds
monitoring "all the things" when it comes to their infrastructure and
applications. Too often this myopia results in high-risk/low-value monitoring
systems. In this talk, we'll step back, set better goals, and discuss design
pitfalls.

## Description

In this presentation we'll re-examine monitoring to understand how to
formulate valuable goals and align monitoring design and implementation with
those goals.  With a focus on outcomes and behavior that leads to outcomes
we'll focus on performance data and not security monitoring. 

Attendees will learn to ask the right questions when approaching the
monitoring of systems and businesses. They will understand why and how
monitoring should fit into the overall systems architecture to reduce risk and
increase value.
