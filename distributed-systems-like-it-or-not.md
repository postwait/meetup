# Distributed Systems, Like It or Not

##### Speaker: Theo Schlossnagle

## Abstract 

Systems today are scaled up and down rapidly and launched on infrastructure we
assume to go away at a moments notice. To maintain availability, distributed
systems concepts were introduced (both formal and ad-hoc)... and as SREs we
must reason about them.

## Descriptin

Over the last twenty years, complex distributed systems have been deployed to
solve the leading challenges in the systems resiliency and robustness realm.
At this point in systems architecture design, distributed systems are
everywhere in everything; even the most simple architectures incorporate
distributed software and carry with that the failure scenarios they bring. 

SREs are put in an even more complicated situation, because of their wide net
or responsibilities, to manage distributed systems of distributed systems.
Things can and will go wrong and one of the fundamental skills for SREs going
forward will be strong distributed systems reasoning skills. 

In this talk we discuss the types of failure scenarios that distributed
systems bring with them (with anecdotes) and develop various reasoning skills
that can be used to tackle these challenges with increased confidence.
